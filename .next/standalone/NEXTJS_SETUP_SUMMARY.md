# Next.js Migration - Initial Setup Complete

## ✅ What's Been Done

### 1. Next.js Installation & Configuration
- ✅ Installed Next.js 16.x with React 19
- ✅ Created `next.config.js` with image optimization and webpack config
- ✅ Created `jsconfig.json` for path aliases (`@/*` pointing to `src/*`)
- ✅ Created `.nextignore` file

### 2. App Router Structure
- ✅ Created `app/` directory with App Router structure
- ✅ Created root `app/layout.jsx` with metadata and global styles
- ✅ Created `app/globals.css` importing existing styles
- ✅ Created all page routes:
  - `app/page.jsx` (Home)
  - `app/about/page.jsx`
  - `app/services/page.jsx`
  - `app/services/[slug]/page.jsx` (Dynamic service pages)
  - `app/contact/page.jsx`
  - `app/blog/page.jsx`
  - `app/blog/[slug]/page.jsx` (Dynamic blog posts)
  - `app/not-found.jsx`

### 3. API Routes
- ✅ Created `app/api/contact/route.js` with full contact form handler
- ✅ Includes webhook integration
- ✅ Includes email sending (admin + user)
- ✅ Includes WhatsApp message sending
- ✅ Installed `nodemailer` dependency

### 4. Component Updates
- ✅ Updated `Layout.jsx` to work with Next.js (removed React Router, uses `children` prop)
- ✅ Updated `Contact.jsx` to use `/api/contact` endpoint
- ✅ Added `'use client'` directive to Layout

### 5. Package.json
- ✅ Updated scripts:
  - `dev` → `next dev`
  - `build` → `next build`
  - `start` → `next start`
  - Kept old Vite scripts as `dev:vite`, `build:vite` for reference

## 🔄 What Still Needs to Be Done

### Critical: Component Migration

All components using React Router need to be updated:

1. **Replace React Router imports:**
   ```jsx
   // OLD
   import { Link, useLocation, useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom'
   
   // NEW
   import Link from 'next/link'
   import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'
   import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'
   ```

2. **Components to update:**
   - `Navbar.jsx` - Uses Link, useLocation, useNavigate
   - `Footer.jsx` - Uses Link
   - `ScrollSmootherWrapper.jsx` - Uses useLocation
   - `ScrollToTop.jsx` - Uses useLocation
   - `Contact.jsx` - Uses useSearchParams (already partially updated)
   - `Logo.jsx` - Uses Link
   - `Hero.jsx` - Uses Link
   - `About.jsx` - Uses Link
   - `Services.jsx` - Uses Link
   - `ServicesMarquee.jsx` - Uses Link
   - `CTA.jsx` - Uses Link
   - `WhyChoose.jsx` - Uses Link
   - `BreadcrumbSchema.jsx` - Uses useLocation

3. **Add 'use client' directive** to all components that:
   - Use React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
   - Use browser APIs (window, document, etc.)
   - Use event handlers
   - Use context

### Pages Updates

- Update pages to work with Next.js params (for dynamic routes)
- Remove any React Router dependencies
- Ensure proper metadata exports

### Testing

- [ ] Test all routes work correctly
- [ ] Test API route (`/api/contact`)
- [ ] Test build process
- [ ] Test production build

### Deployment

- [ ] Update deployment scripts
- [ ] Configure environment variables for Next.js
- [ ] Update server configuration if needed

## 🚀 How to Test Current Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Note:** The app won't work fully yet because components still use React Router. You'll need to update those components first.

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Start with Navbar** - It's the most critical component
2. **Update Footer** - Simple Link replacements
3. **Update other components** - One by one
4. **Test as you go** - Make sure each component works before moving on
5. **Update pages** - Ensure dynamic routes work
6. **Test build** - Run `npm run build` to check for errors

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Keep React Router installed** until all components are migrated (for gradual migration)
- **Test incrementally** - Don't try to update everything at once
- **Backup your work** - Commit frequently as you make progress
- **The old Vite setup still works** - You can switch back with `npm run dev:vite` if needed
